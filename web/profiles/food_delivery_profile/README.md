Food Delivery Profile
------------

Food delivery is a multifunctional, commercial profile that was created specifically for online stores of any complexity.

It provides a flexible catalog with which users can quickly find suitable products. A shopping cart that works without reloading the current page does not distract customers from the buying process. There are detailed checkout pages where you can check an information on each step. An information page where you can tell us about your company and features of its work. There is a contact page feedback form.

So, you can always be aware of wishes of your customers. Besides, we added a typography page which shows the entire design of the food delivery profile.
